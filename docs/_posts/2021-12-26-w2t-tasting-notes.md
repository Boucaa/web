## Ripe Puerh

### [2017 Old Reliable](https://white2tea.com/products/2017-old-reliable)

- strong woody taste
- basic, yet enjoyable brew
- very representative taste of the ripe puerh category
- no nonsense value tea - simple and cheap (0.0825 USD/g), good daily drinker

### [2016 Cream](https://white2tea.com/products/2016-cream)

- my favourite W2T ripe so far
- as the name suggests - creamy and smooth
- very approachable for a ripe
- a bit more expensive at 0.175 USD/g, but totally worth it
- ordered a second cake

### [2018 Waffles](https://white2tea.com/products/2018-waffles)

- smooth texture
- dark flavor profile, wood and cocoa
- there's nothing agressive, so I'd say it's a good tea for beginners, but the bitterness is maybe a bit too much, especially since it's not really balanced by any higher notes or sweetness
- ok tea as a daily drinker, not sure if it's the best for my palate

### [2021 Lumber Slut](https://white2tea.com/products/2021-lumber-slut)

- as the name suggests, strong wood flavor and dry texture
- not very complex, but I don't consider that a downside
- enjoyable for me, but it's definitely a personal choice
- I wouldn't drink this every day, it really depends on the mood - great tea for gloomy weather

## White Tea

### [2018 Nightlife](https://white2tea.com/products/2018-nightlife)

- my first cake of white tea
- tastes similar to a young raw puerh, which makes sense due to the origin
  - honey-like sweetness with a bit of a raw punch

- I like to brew this with boiling water to get a heavy full-bodied brew
- easy to overbrew, make sure to not use too much leaf
- an enjoyable tea to sit down, relax and let your thoughts wander

## Oolong

### [Snowflake Dancong](https://white2tea.com/products/snowflake-dancong-1)

- ok tea, hasn't impressed me so far, maybe I'm brewing it wrong
- a clear fruity phoenix aroma right from the start, accompanied by an unexpected vegetal note, which I stopped noticing after the second steep
- easy to overbrew

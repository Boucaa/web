One day, I was browsing an online store to purchase a few sewing supplies. At around 1 am when I was tiredly finishing the order, I came across this fun looking webbing and came up with the idea. My 10 year old belt that I got for free with a pair of jeans is slowly disintegrating, so I saw this as a perfect oportunity for an experiment.

I paid around \$1 for 2 buckles and \$2 for 5 m of the webbing, so the cost of one unit comes out to about $1. Took me about 10 minutes to figure out the assembly, sew 1 bar tack on one end and burn the edges.

Super easy and functional.

The webbing seems a bit too thin to hold up long term and I can't easily put the buckle through the belt loops on my jeans. So if I were to do it again, I would buy thicker webbing and find a G hook (I love G hooks, but the store didn't sell them).

*Just a single bar tack to hold one side in place.*
